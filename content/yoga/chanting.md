If you winced, or rolled your eyes, having seen the title, this is for you. I’m certain someone will have! If you struggle with the idea of going to a yoga class and being forced against your will to chant foreign words along with the rest of the class, this is for you.

When human’s make a simple sound together, it harks back to a time of primal existence. Every culture that’s ever existed has understood their own form of making sound together, as a group. What could be more elemental than communicating hopes, fears, and advice through a common language? Over time that elemental sound has developed to more complex words and sentence, and the groups have found more formal structure, the verse and language itself adhering more to sets of grammatical rules. The chant’s I’ve enjoyed the most have been the simplistic, single syllables, made together in the group.

The meaning of the chant might be known by the teacher, they might explain the background, but to me the action itself is just as important as the message, if not more so. When we contribute to this common sound, one can be washed with a powerful sense of belonging to the group. That is what communication through language is all about, the connection of minds that would otherwise be distinct minds. Take those minds and unite them through common understanding of raw and simple sound. Chant phonetically, removing understanding of the words and enjoy that moment of being supported by fellow yogi’s, being carried through the moment on communal sound. When immersed fully, it can feel like the whole body reverberates on a separate plane of that sound. It might be hard to know for sure whether you’re still contributing at all.

It’s the sounds that matter perhaps more than the actual words, and the feeling of belonging is not that dissimilar from singing a drinking song in the pub, or joining a local choir*. So how about this, next time you’re at a yoga class and about to chant, forget the words and just feel the sound.

*Or even a boy band. Imagine yourself singing in a boy/girl band about how you’re hoping the boy/girl next door might hold your hand on the way to school. It’s probably not that dissimilar from phonetic chanting.]
