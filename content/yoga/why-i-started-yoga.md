This is the question that get’s asked in the five minutes before class.

‘Why did you start yoga, then?’

I had forgotten how to sit on the floor. That’s my answer. There’s no telling when such a thing might have happened. No doubt it’s over a long period of time one loses such a skill.

I remember sitting on the floor when I was much younger, reading books on the floor of my childhood bedroom for an entire weekend. I must have spent hours playing with Lego sitting on the floor and I never remember it being too much effort. Sometimes I’d lie on my back with my legs above me on the mattress of the bed. Sitting on the floor was a lot more comfortable when I was that age than when I was in my first yoga class. I couldn’t sit cross legged without getting uncomfortable after five minutes. Sitting in Dandasana was such an effort, I felt for many weeks that I was going to fall over backwards. Remaining upright was as much as work as doing sit-ups.

I went to my first yoga class without thinking about the logistics of such an event. Of course they sit on the floor, but some naivety perhaps prevented me thinking that <em>I</em> would be sitting on the floor. I didn’t know what to expect so I chose not to expect anything, but we were indeed sat on the floor.

There is a sense of child-like wonder I get when I sit on the floor. It is a Proustian moment of mine. Being thrown back to a time where life was so simple that I could spend the never ending weekend doing absolutely whatever I liked. There were no lists of things I needed to do just to keep myself in society, no bills to pay, no assumed expectation that I needed to be out and about meeting people. I remember a much greater sense of ‘Where I am right now is exactly where I need to be and there’s no problem with that’.

I remember some of the projects I would embark on during a long Summer holiday. Complexity didn’t seem to be any obstacle. No building project, or drawing, or collaboration, would seem insurmountable.

Invariably Summer would end, school would restart and all of a sudden I’d find myself without the time to idle around working on these projects, some of them completed, some of them not, it didn’t matter. But something new would always come up the next weekend or the next holiday.

Yoga helped restore in me the wonder I had when I was care-free and without quite as many expectations of myself.

I have been reminded that there was a time when, during a project, even though I hadn’t finished <em>quite</em> yet, that it was okay to be in that state of not <em>quite</em> finished.

I’m a strong promoter of having personal goals, but sometimes it’s best that goal is just to sit on the floor. Maybe sit for just a while, maybe sit for a whole Summer.
