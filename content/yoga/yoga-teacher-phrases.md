Here are some phrases I've witnessed from yoga teachers over the years! I'm just as guilty as the next teacher on some of these. Have you ever heard anything like these in class?

<hr />

<h2>'Just one more round of Surya Namaskar'</h2>
You said that on the last round!

Standing at the front edge of the mat, exhausted from the one more round you just completed. You can feel the beads of sweat starting to make their way down your forehead.You're certain that if you moved your feet a little bit on the mat, it would squelch. The backs of your legs feel like the first time you had a go with a foam roller. As he walks around the room, beaming at his own sense of power, with the smirk, a clue about his self administered comedic awards. 'just one more'. sickening.  You look across the room at your dishevelled peers, and deep down in their eyes might have been the embodiment of hatred, if only it wasn't clouded by their sense of helplessness, life is now Sun Salutations. There is nothing more.

Yoga is hard sometimes :P
<h2>'Who'd like a spray of 'Lavender and Maccachuckawu aromatherapy oil' during Savasana?'</h2>
"That's okay thanks. My yoga top, despite being washed three times since, still smells vaguely of last weeks 'Kumquat and Cranberry Sauce'"
<h2>'Just do what your body feels!'</h2>
I could probably do that at home.

Like the waiter who asks how your meal is just as you've taken a mouthful. Just as you've summoned all your might to get up into what may be your best ever Urdvah Dhanurasana, as you finally release the head back into your shoulders, the teacher suggests it's now time to move on. Usually at this point in the class it's the person next to you who is usually doing something brave, today she's just having a little lie down. You open your eyes a moment, upside down,  everyone in the room is waiting patiently for you to stop fooling around in Wheel so they can carry on with what's next.
<h2>'Next week I leave for my annual 12 week holiday in India, see you in the Winter!'</h2>
Have fun teacher, I'll be sure to keep up the practice in the kitchen of my mid terrace flat while you're there.

Okay, okay, broad stereotypes I know! I love you all &lt;3
