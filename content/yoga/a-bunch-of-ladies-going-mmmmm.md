In my notes for this post, I had the basic idea and how I was going to approach it. Get rid of the misconceptions around yoga such as the common 'group of middle aged women talking about the moon'* and give the first-timer an idea of what they might expect at their first class. But all my lines of thought into what a yoga class <em>is, </em>fell apart as I worked on them. The only theme I came to, was this.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yoga will fuck you.</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

If you are reading this as a potential first-timer, I might have to elaborate a bit.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hard.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okay okay! Enough of that. Sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there's two ways of looking at this. A good yoga class will develop and evolve, respond each week to the gradual change in attendees. Your first class might be one where that group is working hard on a physical practice. The good teacher (because it's a good class) will look after you and take you through what the rest of your classmates are doing, you'll work at your own pace, keeping up where you can but you might struggle with some of the stronger stuff. But under the expert guidance you'll leave the class somewhere between relaxed, stretched, but probably also feeling a little bit battered, and a little bit fucked. And that's fine, but that's not the sort of fucked I mean. Here's the second way of looking at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There will be a time, (it's unlikely that this will be the first class), perhaps a few months in, perhaps a few years in. You'll have the framework of your teacher's class pretty much in muscle memory and you'll get settled in like every other class. But there will be some mixture of events that don't quite fit together. The evolution of the class will be at a point where you and everyone else is going much more slowly than usual. Not abnormally slow, but just enough. And there might be a longer hold of one pose than you're used to. The plucky new student across the room might have done something you were sure took you hours of practice to get right. And all these things will manifest by creating this vacuum, a vacuum somewhere which is desperate to equalise. You'll start questioning what it's all about, unsure of whether you're in the right place. I mean, I've been convinced that I'm on the wrong plane of existence at some classes. That vacuum will appear when it appears, and once you've noticed it, it is then. That is when this series of minor differences will blindside you, that is when yoga will fuck you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I've left class feeling like my whole world vision has just been pulled open and whisked. I've cried in class. I've stayed behind after class to confess to being a phoney and an impostor. But over time that vacuum does equalise. I think of it like a vacuum because it's the sudden removal of something which is no longer needed. Something which you were carrying, some anxiety, some core belief which you have pushed deep down inside to hide, and then all of a sudden you find what's needed to remove it and set it on it's way. And when that thing goes, it's hurts, but it goes, and it equalises.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">In Summary</h3>
Your first class <em>is</em> going to be rolling around on the floor for a bit, pretending to be a tree for a bit, and <del>snoozing</del> performing relaxation. But stick with it, and there's a whole other world in there.

* Okay, this does happen. But it's on the surface, there's a bigger picture.
