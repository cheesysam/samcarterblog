### Also Known As...'Your Mind'
It's a phenomenal force, isn't it? Every great work of art, every documented scientific process, and every shit TV series, are all works of someones mind (or collection of minds).
<h3>But What Else?</h3>
The effects of anxiety, stress, and depression can lead to poor physical health. The reverse is also true. By practicing techniques such as meditation to improve mood, physical health can improve or be maintained. The system of mind and body are connected and respond to each others ails. If one becomes ill then the other might follow, but making ourselves aware of frailties in both areas I think is the first step towards improving.
<h3>The Point</h3>
I'm a firm believer in you, and your ability to forge incredible benefits for you. Sometimes we need to learn processes and techniques to achieve it, but there are often times we are offered aids which claim to have the same power. So it's all coming down to this.
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>If you have to <em>believe</em> in 𝒙, for 𝒙 to work, the power is all a result of the mind, not a result of 𝒙.</strong></h4>
&nbsp;

Your mind has the power to do all of those good things. But it doesn't need, <em>say, </em>common minerals sitting in a circle around you to do it. (In a lot of the crystal healing literature found I looked at, it appears Quartz is considered quite the panacea. It also represents 12% of the earth's crust. It's been used in pretty much every timekeeping device made since 1927, including computers and mobile phones. In short, it's everywhere. You can walk up hills and just pick it up.)

I wouldn't call it uncommon for <em>some</em> people in the yoga world to take this stuff a <em>bit </em>too seriously. If anyone tells me that I have to open my mind to something for it to work, that's where I lose interest in that thing.

There <em><strong>are</strong></em> a number of practices in yoga which take a bit of a leap of faith to get benefit from. Chanting is something I wouldn't have had any buy into off my own back. But encouragement from the right people and a rational approach to what those benefits might be turned it into something tangible for me. You can read my convincer on chanting <a href="http://www.yogaseriousnotserious.com/2017/02/10/chanting/">here</a>! I think meditation would probably have been shunned by a lot of people not that many years ago. Luckily we're realising the benefits of meditation as a society more and more these days. (You don't need to buy anything for that either, not apps, not a special meditation cushion, not a singing bowl). This is representative of the separation between 'having a go at something and realising the benefits for yourself', and 'being told that something is only going to work if you put faith in it'. Not everything is going to work for everyone, chanting and meditation included, but it's worth a go!

Yoga is for everyone, and everyone's mind. You don't need to buy rocks to help. You can if you want to, but only if they look nice.
