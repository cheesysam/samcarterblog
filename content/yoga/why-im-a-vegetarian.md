well, it fits the rest of the image, doesn't it?

i've been vegetarian since august 2014. not very long relatively, but long enough to have made my mind up about whether or not i'm sticking to it. the following is what i make of it all.
<h3>a bit technical, to start</h3>
humanity is at a point where we know exactly what the body needs and doesn't need. there are recommended intake figures for everything, for example, b12 measured in the micrograms (2.4 as it happens, that is, 2.4 <em>millionths</em> of a gram). these values are so small that it's only very recently that we've been able to measure such things. b12 was only discovered in 1934, so your parents, or perhaps their parents would only just have known about it, had they been in circles which talked about such things.

so we know what the body needs. but the other half of the knowledge we require is not just what quantities are needed, but we also need to know what quantities are provided. and we do, we know what is provided by all of our food. the average large egg has 0.44 micrograms of b12. easy peasy, do the maths, you won't miss anything your body needs to be super duper. there is available a satisfactory alternative means of nutrition.
<h3>but meat is delicious, right?</h3>
well, i'm not so sure about that. not <em>inherently </em>delicious. looking at social history it's not that long ago that eating all sorts of offal was common. tripe and onions anyone? food follows fashion as much as anything else follows the fashion. todays fashion is white chicken breast doused in peri-peri. in a couple of generations time won't it be remembered as the most bland cut of meat disguised as something exotic?

understanding of our chemical composure and requirements has developed, the other thing which is forever <del>developing</del> changing is human morality. what was acceptable before, is not acceptable now, and of course the opposite is also true. are we not at a point in human existence where there is no requirement for captivation of animals for food? traditional inuit diet is almost completely meat, eggs, and fish. in an arctic locale where agriculture isn't possible, i'd be eating as much whale blubber as the next guy. but when we're in a society where agriculture is possible in every corner of the country is there a reason to raise animals for food?

we've got the knowledge, and we've got the method.
<h3>pizza</h3>
there is obviously the added question of dairy. i am not a vegan. i think done well, egg farming is fine. if resource allowed i'd definitely have a couple of laying hens clucking around in the back garden but for now i buy eggs i trust. milk; not so keen on having a dairy cow roaming the garden, but i put enough trust in farmers to do a good job of that for me.
<h3>eating mindfully</h3>
whether you eat meat or not doesn't matter to me especially, i believe it more important to consider the impact you're having on the whole system. as individuals it's easier to believe we have only little impact, but collectively these impacts are amplified. eating lamb that has been reared down the road is one thing, but eating new zealand lamb is bonkers. would you rather be eating high welfare meat and spending more money on it but only occasionally, or would you rather mass produced....'meat'.....every night?

in christian culture saying a prayer before eating is the tradition. i'm not aware of any such equivalent in yogic tradition, but occasionally coming back to show gratitude for meals can have positive effects on how we eat. if you're taking the time to be considerate over food, then chances are you'll be eating better food, and also eating in better moderation.
