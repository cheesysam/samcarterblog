Many of us are bound to set a New Years resolution at some point, and no doubt some of those will be to adopt a daily Yoga practice. In observing this societal tradition myself I considered how this commitment to daily practice fits with the Niyama-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas_(Sanskrit)">Tapas</a>.

Tapas is often translated to something along the lines of self-discipline. In Patanjali's Yoga sutras we see Tapas broken into three main categories. Austerity, study, and the dedication of ones efforts to Yoga.

Austerity deserves a special mention, for the word 'austerity' is accompanied by negative emotion. The austere suffer no luxuries, and work by strict policy. By taking austerity in this manner, the practitioner might be forgiven for feeling a dedicated daily practice as a burden rather than a joy or positive step. Something that I believe should be included in more Yoga literature is we practice this because it's fun! Because it feels good! Yoga teachers are missing a trick by saying 'this really works your core', it's covering up what's really important, the enjoyment. Excuse yourself a moment of hedonism.

Study and dedication remain. By setting a New Year's resolution such as ensuring we practice Yoga every day, we are taking steps towards this self discipline and study. Only through practice can improvements be made, this sentiment is found throughout many texts. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika prescribes 'The practitioner will succeed, the non practitioner will not' - Chapter 1, Verse 64. The Bhagavad Gita says 'But by constant practice and by freedom from passions the mind in truth can be trained' - Chapter 6, Verse 35, in this case meaning that despite the complexities of the mind, the thought waves can be stilled through Yoga and conscientious effort on the path.

It is of course not only in Yoga we find practice as the solution to progress, but it's worth remembering that everyone who has come before you on the path of Yoga has only found development from within themselves, within their own efforts.

I wish you all the best with any New Years resolution you have made. Let me know how it works out.
