<h3>The Same Page</h3>
Okay, okay. First we have to align our understanding of what reincarnation means. How about every time a creature (human or otherwise) dies, their soul, which they’ve developed over their lifetime, is suddenly free of it’s physical constraints and whisks itself over to another physical body which is not yet occupied by a soul? Thus that original union of body and soul is lost, but the soul part carries on in a new body to continue it’s development? Okay, okay, there’s the description of what our common belief in reincarnation is probably <em>not</em> going to look like. The transmigration of a soul to a newly born creature is pretty fantastical, and nothing if not romantic. Perhaps why such a belief persists is just that, the romanticism around it, the hope that nobody really dies, hope that life is eternal, and a strong opposition to accepting that this life is ‘it’.
<h3>The Proposition</h3>
An alternative I think we might unite on is this. The passing on of the soul between physical bodies. Okay, okay, that part is the same. But the difference being this process not occurring in an instant at the point of death/birth, but over the course of lifetimes.

We are born into this world which already has an established culture. Alongside the literal world which is at a certain level of understanding through scientific development, and the non-literal world which has it’s own theories developed over generations. These as distinct entities, and conjoined, have agreed on some things and disagreed on others. Religion has been trying to work these things out for millennia, and there is us, and billions of people around us trying to work it out for ourselves too.

And so at our birth the process starts. The physical body spends a long time, decades, absorbing from around it the culture, the spirit of the rest of the humanity, learning what it needs to build upon, and laying it’s own foundations for what our own self is going to start to believe.

We learn from our immediate family. To start with that learning is without criticism. Our parents <em>surely</em> do things the way everyone does. But as we reach out to other sources, perhaps school teachers and friends, ideas start to broaden, and perhaps we notice that rock which our blood relatives once was, isn’t quite as solid as it first appeared. There is a realisation of right and wrong, and that our parents, maybe just sometimes, might be on the wrong side of that line. It is a matrix of morality and choice we are navigating through, but with no absolute path.

The journey continues, developing our own ideas from what we witness in the world around us. Stories on the news, the good and the bad. The topics which our celebrities sing and dance about. Paintings and books and poetry and graffiti and tattoos and photos and fashion and architecture, all of this (and more) moulds us over time. There may be individuals in the limelight we feel particularly aligned to, their attitudes more reactive with us than others. This process never stops for as long as we are alive.

But then over time there is a gradual transition, we are always learning but there is a time where we have the foundations to start imparting that accumulation to the next lives. Everything we’ve established having seen where humanity is today and adding to it that tiny fragment of our own self.

It’s not always through a conscious act of ‘teaching’, but through our actions and our ideas, and through the way we portray ourselves. What we create to leave behind, and how we react to the creation of others. All these things contribute to those who listen. Firstly, to the people immediately around us, and secondly, to the society of tomorrow. The response of those immediate people around us gives quick feedback, but when there are many people contributing that same idea or act to society, there is more subtle feedback but bigger changes are made. And the new lives, they are desperate to learn, they are ready to absorb what the rest of humanity has to offer.
<h3>Different for everyone</h3>
But it’s not the same for all of us. Writers have an image of spending a lot of their lives accumulating, before being able to share back their own development. Whereas others of us have something to add far earlier in life, but perhaps it’s little and often rather than something more revolutionary all at once.
<h3>Reincarnation V2.0</h3>
Okay, okay. So the message is be nice and make nice things and contribute back to the system that raised you to be nice. The next generation will be nicer for it. It’s a twee sentiment, but I believe that’s reincarnation. And surely we can agree on that being a good thing?

The way in which you act outwardly is your chance at living forever. You might not be remembered as a hero of your day. But along with your neighbours and their neighbours, along with your football team, your colleagues, your bridge partner, and that girl on the telly you like, let’s be nice. And if we do it right, we might just about be able to avoid being remembered as the one’s who fucked it all up*.

*That made for a nice sharp finish eh? But honestly, I think we’re doing alright. We’re getting better all the time, despite what the 24 hour rolling news coverage would have you believe. We’re doing alright.
