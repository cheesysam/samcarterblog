The Sage, Patanjali, talks of thought-waves orÂ <em>vritti</em> as one of the fundamental parts of our Hatha Yoga practice. Every time we let a thought through the mind, it sets a wave which passes unhindered through our psyche. But the wake of the wave not only continues long after the initial wavefront passes, but builds up in the mind what is called Samskaras. The Samskara is the residual build up of numerous thought-waves over long periods of time. Ultimately these Samskara are what combine to form our character. Put more plainly, if you spend your days thinking negatively and pursuing negative actions, these will later manifest themselves as your character.

Yoga is the control of these thought-waves. Taking time into your day to work towards positive action, right mind, and right thought, is all yoga. Let the wake of each of these waves settle into your very being. It would be wrong to expect revolutionary changes of character overnight, but over longer periods of time we can work to undo what we have carried for so long, and find our inner-being once more.
