Recently, the yoga class I regularly attend had a newcomer. Without knowing it she proved something to me about where positivity comes from and how to keep hold of it.

This girl had clearly been dragged there by her very keen and skinny friend. This class is one with an 'advanced' label but our practice varies a lot. So this newcomer was a bit overweight. Nevertheless, she was putting at least as much effort in as anyone else. However about halfway through, after working with plank a bit, something emotional was triggered and there were a few tears from the newcomer, due to feeling perhaps a bit incapable. Our teacher without a moments thought came over with some amazing words of reassurance and the situation was sorted. Smiles all round.

For the rest of the class I was thinking about the whole exchange. It won't be long before I'm a qualified teacher, how would I have handled this?! (The answer to this I still don't know)...

But here's the point. During our final half of the class and all through relaxation, I was thinking about all the things I might have said to a girl in a similar situation in my class. Positive cliches perhaps, 'Yoga is for every body!', 'Who you are today isn't who you'll be tomorrow!', or maybe a more calming philosophical cliche 'We are each on our own path'....

The worry of how I would handle such a situation continued, and in my head was a cycle of thinking how I might word this positivity to one of my own students. Repeatedly thinking these positive thoughts. Positive thoughts...over and over again.

But despite these thoughts being derived from worry, it wasn't long before I was feeling a sense of elation! One that I couldn't remember having for months if not years. I left that class beaming all the way home. From <em>trying</em> to think with an open heart, trying to push this positivity on somebody else, it worked inwardly.

I felt quite guilty afterwards. Perhaps I <em>should</em> have said some of those things to my yoga neighbour for the evening!

Patanjali talks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)">Samskara</a>, the thoughtwaves of the mind. The continued thoughts we have can eventually define who we are through our character. Through this repetition of outward positivity I began forging my own Samskara. It's all about the continuation of this practice. Even in recalling the story to write about I'm beginning to feel that experience all over again.
