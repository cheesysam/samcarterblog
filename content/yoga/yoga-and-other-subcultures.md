<h3>Once Upon a Time</h3>
A decade ago in Birmingham, there was what I saw as quite a thriving rock subculture. No doubt there are those who were there a decade before that claiming to see the watering down of their own. Who doesn’t think that about their own existence, that theirs was the time to be a part of it?! But by the time I was ready to leave the city, ‘my’ part of the subculture had run it’s course. I think to investigate the same haunts now as I was then inhabiting then would be a sobering experience.

Those of us in the circle, we wore the same clothes, and we went to the same places. We ate the same food, and we listened to the same music*. We were labelled, and we were either marketed to, or marketed ‘at’. Even the rock club in Birmingham at the time was called ‘subculture’.

The telling thing to me now is just that, that we were marketed at. Looking back at those years I especially remember the griminess of it all, the people, the places. Only now do I start to wonder, or realise, that the marketing was suitably equivalent on purpose to match our assumed attitudes.
<h3>Yoga, the subculture</h3>
Think of a person who practices yoga. I’d guess you’ve gone for one of two images. A Western Female in their twenties or thirties with a yoga mat bag over their shoulder, probably in leggings. Less so but perhaps also likely, an Indian Male dressed in orange robes with a big beard. If the marketing is anything to go by then it is the former which you have jumped to, but that’s not to say I’m particularly enamoured with the latter as very yogic either.
No matter which variation, the subculture is still present. There is the clothing, music, lifestyle, location, and lastly, marketing campaigns.
<h3>Yoga, for?</h3>
From the Hatha Yoga Pradipika:

"Yoga is for the young, the old, the very old, the sick, or the weak"……"Success is achieved neither by wearing the right clothes, nor by talking about it. Practice alone brings success."

It does well to take these claims with a skeptical eye. This is, after all, the same book which makes some fairly off the wall statements about conquering death. But it does make a valid point about who can benefit from practicing yoga, and it’s not those who wear the right clothes and talk about the right things. It is everyone. Not just those that the marketeers will have you believe.

Come to class, no matter what your vibe.

<strong>If you’ve never been to class with me before and come along mentioning this blog post, then you can have that class for free!</strong>

* We also got our piercings done in the same place, but that didn’t fit in with the analogy as well ;)
