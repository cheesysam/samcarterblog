First post of a new series! Here's the idea. We'll go through the alphabet picking a yoga related topic for each letter. I'll pick a few related words. Over time we'll build up a sort of yoga dictionary. Amazing. Let's start with A.
<h1>Ashtanga</h1>
Ashtanga is a style of yoga developed by yogi, fitness guru, and sadist K. Pattabhi Jois in 'the late 20th century' according to Wikipedia. The practice is centred around The Primary Series which is a predefined set of poses held for a set amount of breaths each.
<h4>Vinyasa</h4>
Vinyasas are a sort of practical joke which got out of hand, possibly as a result of a bad translation. In between almost every pose in an Ashtanga class is a vinyasa flow which includes a push-up, a backbend, and downward facing dog....in between every pose for 90 minutes. Hahaha I know right!?
<h4>Kino Macregor</h4>
Kino is a practitioner of Ashtanga Yoga, but she's also very attractive which has therefore brought her increased fame. Wearing not many clothes also contributes to her success, and at the last count she has over 1 billion followers on Instagram, some of whom are interested in yoga.
<h4>Mysore</h4>
Mysore is a popular style of Ashtanga class and is named after the Indian city. A Mysore class isn't led by a teacher, rather the attendees practice at their own pace and are expected to know how to get through the primary series already. The teacher in a Mysore class is more of a facilitator employed to unlock the door to let people in. Having said that, Mysore teachers do occasionally employ guilt-based techniques to make sure you are doing all the required vinyasas.
