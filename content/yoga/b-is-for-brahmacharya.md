Here we go.
<h1>Brahmacharya</h1>
Brahmacharya is one of the Yamas. Brahmacharya is roughly translated as the 'right use of energy'. An effort to conserve energy for the higher purpose of meditation. If you can't work out where this is going yet then I've spent a little while coming up with some modern alternative translations. Which one do you reckon is most succinct?
<ol>
 	<li>Don't put it about.</li>
 	<li>Stop being a slag.</li>
 	<li>No naughty business in the monks sleeping quarters.</li>
</ol>
Hopefully you get the idea. There is only one related word which needs explaining, here it is.
<h4>Yamas</h4>
These are the yoga equivalents of the ten commandments. Equivalently subjective. Equally outdated. And just as prone to 'slipping one's mind' when appropriate.

Have a great weekend all!

PS. It took me a little while to decide between this and "Breathe". Not just the actual word breathe but the desperate instruction of yoga teachers. "Annnnnd Breaaaaatttttthhhhhheeeee". But we can come back to that at some point.
