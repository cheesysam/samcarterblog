<h3>The Brahman and the Atman</h3>
One of the fundamental teachings of yoga is the Atman and the Brahman. The Brahman is the whole manifestation of the universe and everything it contains. We are part of that system, and the part of the Brahman we have within ourselves is called the Atman. Yoga is the union of our Atman to the whole Brahman.

There is no difference between my composition as well as it's belonging to the whole, and your composition, and your belonging to the whole. This goes for me and you and every being.

The modern explanation of such an idea is no different. The raw materials we are each made from are no different to the raw materials our neighbour is made from. It is easy for us to think of the edge of our skin as the edge of our 'self', and anything beyond that is foreign. But look at it at a molecular level and there is no boundary. The matter inside and the matter outside is just the same. The edges of our selves are a lot more blurred than imaginable. Where we end and where the air begins is not a clear cut line.

(If you were really looking closely, my understand is the electron parts of some of those atoms due to their quantum nature would even be shared at the same time between you and everything around you. We're all in the same big soup of physical matter.)
<h3>My (naive) History Lesson</h3>
Disclaimer: I'm no history buff, but here's my take on the past and present attitudes towards arbitrary lines. Us humans historically, have had an alarming tendency towards segregation.
<ul>
 	<li>America has relatively recently had slavery as a conventional practice. It was only 1964 when the United States made segregation illegal.</li>
 	<li>In India, class division has been prevalent for centuries with the caste system. And as I understand it this still persists, promoting the same divides today, at least in some parts of the country.</li>
 	<li>In England it has always been a case of class division. The aristocracy versus 'the great unwashed'. The relics of this still exist in things like official titles and the House of Lords*.</li>
</ul>
No doubt there are plenty of examples in other countries.
<h3>Where are we today / a story of regression</h3>
The past 12 months have seen a number of events which put into question the understanding that we are all the same. Some events the other side of the world, and some events much closer to home. Some of these events have been have been a result of democratic process, and others have been independent acts. The common theme as I see it is a misguided opinion of what it means to be human, or indeed what it means to exist in our universe.
