There was blood in the water.
Dispersing from the epicentre
red smoke just beneath the surface. 
Separated by invisible threads of ghosts
and maybe, memorabilia.

Splinters show through the tablecloth.
Czech hedgehogs with dinner 
a long time before. 
The bell still rang, 
the cable long deceased.

Without boredom and edge
there was staring but no longer 
at the table, rather into palms.
The fingers swipe but don't graze 
like beach landings.
