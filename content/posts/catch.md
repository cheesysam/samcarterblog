We ate outside, discussing species of tree. The helicopter ones, and the ones they have in Japan. We prolonged it somewhat, on account of the heat. The afternoon went quickly, we chatted a lot more than we usually get away with.

At home I played catch with one of the three boys. He’s got a good throw. I had to change clothes before and after due to the heat. 

Later on, our landlords had guests visiting, a mother and daughter. The mother, with no lack of disdain announced to everyone that indoor climbing was the only sport her daughter would agree to participate in. One shouldn’t spend their life indoors and sedentary. Equally one shouldn’t embarrass their teenage children in front of strangers.
