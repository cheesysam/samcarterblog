In keeping with agreed tradition
Le Cafe de Robette they met
Sat outside with two chairs facing
Smokers clouds obscured their vision

Longed for hours but no time wasted
Stems of glasses melting seaward
All about them idle waiters
From the grind, smoking they hid

“Take your hand from mine!” she shouted!
Heads about them turned for nothing
“This is life”, he eyed her protest
“This life? never!”, glaring clearing

And with a step about the table
cobbles wedge an ill placed heel
That sea got closer 
Sharply ingested throat of cloud

Stems fell faster, catching their last
glimpse of smoke, kissed fingertips.
Falling faster like the glass 
she realised, caught, that love is vast.
