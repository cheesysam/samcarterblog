One of the short stories in this book tells of a university progessor, who collects naked photographs of his female students. Particularly photos of their vaginas captured close up from ground level. Reading this is impossible without vividly picturing the resultant photos. The professor in these scenes is naked too, and as a result the girls are excited as he is.

These situations must happen in real life. And don't they sound fantastic!? The divide between those who think it would be a fantastic event and those who don't is clear. There must be very strong opponents and decidedly excitable proponents, but I find myself imagining a lot of men torn between the viewpoints. It would be a good gig to get, wouldn't it? I'd soon overlook any internal opposition.
