When lines are all you can see in a building
one spends most of their life in, it can
be especitally rewarding to see a break
in this monotony with an alarmingly
spherical tree. And I do mean, alarmingly
out of the window. All of a sudden dominating
the landscape with it's perfect
rotundness as if a brannch patterned beach
ball had been flung into the air and stuck
against the rest. And it's unlikely that 
anybody else will give a shit about this
perfectly spherical tree that has reached 
out in all directions but only the exact
distance from the epicentre no matter which
angle you are viewing from. It seems
unlikely now that anybody else would be able
to draw themselves even for a moment away
from the lines and towards your tree.
But that's okay, because you don't need
them to have a good time with your tree.
