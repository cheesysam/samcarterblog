When each other is in opposition
on funeral darkness carrying
only trails behind them, yet
leading into a crawling worming
tether of uniformity ahead

Brakes are often a break in
patience, patience doesn’t persist for
familiar faces. Careful now
for there might never be 
another chance to merge again,

better to risk than wait for
what rises from the horizon as
long as we’re safe we’ll pay.
Explosions hit the darkness and
stay illuminated momentarily.
