Some evenings in this dark candlelit house
in February when Winter feels finished
or like it should at least be ending soon

Some evenings I sit channeling work house misers
counting pennies on left losing friends on right
yet even they had sense to warm themselves

Some evenings I am dressed in many layers
Each one sat just more loosely than the last
Another, madness. On the other hand

Some evenings I long deeply for an answer
no care for summer days nor summer nights
Some evenings I long deeply for an answer
Can there be one more reason to stay warm?
