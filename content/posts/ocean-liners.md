#### Liners

Take ocean liners swaying
on hard paths in soft waters
passing blips

Long hands pass by short hands
Hard beams on quartz steam
reserving effort

Pinholes scatter skies at night
if only we could see them for
the dark clouds

The frequency was too high
and the message on the wave, with the swell
was lost
