The view of India I am familiar with is the one portrayed by the commercial yoga industry. Overlooking the poverty, the violent past, and the 'unwestern' tenets of Hinduism leaves India painted in a positive light. Beneficial when you're trying to sell an ideology to someone.

Newby doesn't have the same goal as a modern yoga teacher. In _Slowly Down the Ganges_, Newby doesn't shy away from pointing out the other side of Hinduism and wider Indian culture. Holy men are put in front of the reader to judge, a memorable example interested only in acquiring alcohol to drink from his polished human skull in exchange for his brand of wisdom. Another holy man found lying naked in front of a local post office, an exhbitionist as explained by a passerby, and allegedly in the game of eating his own faeces. Other recurring characters are the hired boatman, seemingly an entity unto their own whether being paid or not. Another, the railway staff member, often purposely unhelpful, or at least this is how Newby paints them. Rats, sewage, food poisoning, and unscrupulous tradesmen, this is the India the reader is offered.

However, the conversations become more and more difficult to believe. During the course of the journey there are a number of conversations which if you were taking at face value would appear to end with neither party really understanding the other, but this doesn't stop the author painting his own conclusion, usually that he was being treated rudely or was trying to have the wool pulled over his eyes. (Newby takes with him on this journey a letter from the current Prime Minister of India. The document eventually having to be preserved in a plastic wallet as he has attempted to use it at every leg of the journey as a bargaining chip for help from the locals). Conversations which are clearly innocent misunderstanding require patience and an understanding of cultural difference to get past, rather than sudden blame of the other party. 

There are parts of this journey where the history of the British occupation is apparent, and apparent how destructive the occupation was to certain civilisations within the country. There are a number of stories along the journey, stories of Newby's time with the British army in India. One of which involves him and his army companions dressing up as locals to gain entry to a local brothel, describing an encounter with a 12 year old prostitute. It is in no way apologetic, the meeting portrayed as awkward rather than anything else, but nonetheless inexcusable.

Despite the positive parts of the journey, which are few, (the occasional times the party _are_ offered special services or guidance, it isn't positively received), it's hard to see past the arrogant colonialism. I hope India is a more wonderful place than this misunderstood view.
