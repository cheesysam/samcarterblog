      <description>We ate outside, discussing species of tree. The helicopter ones, and the ones they have in Japan. We prolonged it somewhat, on account of the heat. The afternoon went quickly, we chatted a lot more than we usually get away with.
At home I played catch with one of the three boys. He’s got a good throw. I had to change clothes before and after due to the heat.
Later on, our landlords had guests visiting, a mother and daughter.</description>

      <description>It’s disappointing how dictated it is that one will end up like their parents. I struggle to accept that all traits persist. I hope the really irritating things disappear altogether. I really hope they don’t skip a generation.</description>
