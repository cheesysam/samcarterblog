<h3 id="running">Running</h3>

<p>I run a lot at the moment. 5 or 6 days a week. It&rsquo;s a relatively recent pursuit of mine but I&rsquo;ve really started getting into it. This September I&rsquo;ll be running my first marathon which is what all this training is in aid of.</p>

<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m doing between 8-22km runs depending on the day, and a few hours after the run I&rsquo;ll often work with a physical asana practice to reset the legs and get me in shape ready for the next days running. The yoga compliments the running.</p>

<h3 id="the-alternative-view">The Alternative View</h3>

<p>The benefit of yoga to the runners legs is not the only part though. It&rsquo;s more than that one way relationship. I think long distance running has a lot to offer the yogi. Not least is the time with which one has to contemplate things. A lot of runners use headphones as an encouragement, something to energise them along. It is something I often do. However running is definitely nicer without headphones, without distraction running is a chance to take it all in. This is where I believe running starts to look a lot like meditation. Without the distraction of music and just one&rsquo;s surroundings, there is a lot of opportunity to really start tuning in to what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s that state where it&rsquo;s best to withdraw the mind from the physical details, and get straight into the mind, investigating what&rsquo;s there and beginning to take control.</p>

<h3 id="another-parallel">Another Parallel</h3>

<p>A common theme with long distance runners I&rsquo;m aware of is the horrible ache of legs for the first 2 or 3 kilometres. It&rsquo;s a real struggle to tell yourself that your body is capable of running through that ache. It&rsquo;s not necessarily painful, but it&rsquo;s a blocker, and once it passes it passes and you wonder what the problem was now that you&rsquo;re gliding again like normal. (Maybe I&rsquo;m just getting older sooner than I thought!). But this exactly mirrors my experiences with meditation. There&rsquo;s a period of sitting where I&rsquo;m never sure whether I&rsquo;m going to be comfortable at all. A period where it feels like all odds are against me getting into this meditation thing at all. But the common point is these initial aches and struggles pass, and what&rsquo;s beyond them is the good stuff. Once past the runners ache or the meditators &lsquo;pins and needles&rsquo;, it can be like being carried on a bed of awesome. Floating through the fields and over stiles, drifting into pure thought and developing a tighter grasp on consciousness. At this point to me the two are interchangeable.</p>

<h3 id="other-benefits">Other Benefits</h3>

<p>Bandha helps running. Breathing helps running. Mantra helps running.</p>

<h3 id="the-exception">The Exception</h3>

<p>The exception is the heat.</p>

<p>The last week has been so hot that running has been a nightmare. Getting past the first 2km ache has gone quicker, but it&rsquo;s been replaced with sweat, and sweat, and hard breathing, and sweat. This is why yogis don&rsquo;t run. Because India is this hot all the time. This week I was out on a 16km run in 28Celsius, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to just be at home in a bath full of ice until that day.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So here it is, I&rsquo;m confident the ancient yogi&rsquo;s would have been runners too, if India wasn&rsquo;t so hot.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-a-message-to-the-doubters">You Can - A Message to the Doubters</h3>

<p>Anyone can run. It&rsquo;s exactly what the human body was built for. A benefit of being upright on two legs is that when we run all our organs are contained in their column of ribcage. Animals that run on 4 legs have internal organs which move backwards and forwards through the ribs when they run. They have an advantage of bursts of speed being low to the ground and four limbs to get them going, but long distance running for four legs is exhausting and uncomfortable as the organs shift in the other plane. Human hunters would track animals across the fields and forests until the animal was just exhausted enough to give up and die. <strong>We are built for this. You are built for this.</strong></p>

<p>(I don&rsquo;t have as much experience with long distance swimming or cycling but I&rsquo;m sure the same principles would apply.)</p>
