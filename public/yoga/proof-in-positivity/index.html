<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">Proof in Positivity</div><div class="section" id="content">Fri Feb 26, 2016 &#183; 414 words

<hr/><p>Recently, the yoga class I regularly attend had a newcomer. Without knowing it she proved something to me about where positivity comes from and how to keep hold of it.</p>

<p>This girl had clearly been dragged there by her very keen and skinny friend. This class is one with an &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; label but our practice varies a lot. So this newcomer was a bit overweight. Nevertheless, she was putting at least as much effort in as anyone else. However about halfway through, after working with plank a bit, something emotional was triggered and there were a few tears from the newcomer, due to feeling perhaps a bit incapable. Our teacher without a moments thought came over with some amazing words of reassurance and the situation was sorted. Smiles all round.</p>

<p>For the rest of the class I was thinking about the whole exchange. It won&rsquo;t be long before I&rsquo;m a qualified teacher, how would I have handled this?! (The answer to this I still don&rsquo;t know)&hellip;</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the point. During our final half of the class and all through relaxation, I was thinking about all the things I might have said to a girl in a similar situation in my class. Positive cliches perhaps, &lsquo;Yoga is for every body!&rsquo;, &lsquo;Who you are today isn&rsquo;t who you&rsquo;ll be tomorrow!&rsquo;, or maybe a more calming philosophical cliche &lsquo;We are each on our own path&rsquo;&hellip;.</p>

<p>The worry of how I would handle such a situation continued, and in my head was a cycle of thinking how I might word this positivity to one of my own students. Repeatedly thinking these positive thoughts. Positive thoughts&hellip;over and over again.</p>

<p>But despite these thoughts being derived from worry, it wasn&rsquo;t long before I was feeling a sense of elation! One that I couldn&rsquo;t remember having for months if not years. I left that class beaming all the way home. From <em>trying</em> to think with an open heart, trying to push this positivity on somebody else, it worked inwardly.</p>

<p>I felt quite guilty afterwards. Perhaps I <em>should</em> have said some of those things to my yoga neighbour for the evening!</p>

<hr />

<p>Patanjali talks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)">Samskara</a>, the thoughtwaves of the mind. The continued thoughts we have can eventually define who we are through our character. Through this repetition of outward positivity I began forging my own Samskara. It&rsquo;s all about the continuation of this practice. Even in recalling the story to write about I&rsquo;m beginning to feel that experience all over again.</p>
