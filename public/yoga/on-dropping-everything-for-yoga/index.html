<hr/><p><h3>Drop Everything.</h3>
Last week I was having a conversation with a wonderful future teacher currently in teacher training, she said (with laughter) that it seems yoga is all that she does now! That it felt like there was no down time for anything else.</p>

<p>I remember during my own teacher training there were periods of time where there was seemingly nothing else than yoga practice and yoga study (and that was even with a day-job to worry about). For those two years there is an expectation to live and breathe yoga. The majority of people probably carry on this all encompassing yoga life past their teacher training, but I think there are differing outlooks, which I hope to write about. Let&rsquo;s call it variable approaches to yogic lifestyle.
<h3>The Variable Yogi - Physical Practice.</h3>
There have been periods of time where I&rsquo;ve made myself feel guilty about not practicing for a few days in a row. The guilt can build up pretty quickly. But there&rsquo;s an internal switch I believe we all have about that sort of guilt, and as soon as you flick that switch from &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; to &lsquo;just be chill about it&rsquo;, then instead of getting on the mat to prevent that guilt it instead becomes asana practice for the right reasons.</p>

<p>The message is don&rsquo;t beat yourself up about missing a day, or even doing 15 minutes and deciding it&rsquo;s not working for you today. Give yourself 15 minutes physical practice and spend some time just sitting for a while. Sitting is fine. <u>FINE</u>.</p>

<p>If you want to do two hours physical practice every day, that&rsquo;s fine too. Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself though, and I&rsquo;m not joining you.</p>

<hr />

<p><h3>Don&rsquo;t Drop Everything.</h3>
Yoga doesn&rsquo;t have a requirement to make enormous changes to the rest of your lifestyle. Being a vegetarian/vegan, giving up smoking, giving up drinking, or any number of other positive changes can be achieved using pursuit of a yogic lifestyle as an excuse. Obviously it&rsquo;s worth doing these things, I&rsquo;m never going to say not to follow those pursuits, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that there&rsquo;s no <b>requirement!</b></p>

<p>Having said that, diving head first into the deep end and getting rid of what you don&rsquo;t need all in one go, it can work (from personal experience), so if yoga is the shakeup you need today, go for it.</p>
