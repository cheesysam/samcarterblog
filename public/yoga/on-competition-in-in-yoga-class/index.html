<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">On Competition in Yoga Class</div><div class="section" id="content">Sun Mar 20, 2016 &#183; 389 words

<hr/><p>Competition in yoga is a difficult one for me, something I&rsquo;ve found a challenge from day one. Often there&rsquo;s not a single other male in my regular class, and I know it sounds so Neanderthal and not at all 21st century but it completely changes my practice when one does show up. I begin striving to push harder and hold longer than my opponents. I write these posts to remind myself of where I can improve as much as anything.</p>

<p>If we think about competition, a yoga competition would indicate there&rsquo;s some &lsquo;best&rsquo; yoga which can be achieved. It suggests there&rsquo;s a finish line. But we&rsquo;re not working towards that perfect ten in yoga, there is no perfection. Every yogi will find themselves in a different place to where they were yesterday, perhaps finding a more heightened sense of balance or a lessensed sense of strength in their practice. However this change of &lsquo;ability&rsquo; is not what defines where the yogi is, it&rsquo;s that awareness of the body, the connection they make between the physical presence and the mind. And as we do find a stronger practice, the day to day change will become more subtle, and it is the subtle awareness of these changes which should improve over time.</p>

<p>The first four of Patanjali&rsquo;s limbs of yoga describe behavioural and physical practices. The remaining four are concerned entirely with working with the mind to bring awareness internally, and describe the increasing levels of concentration within the mind. Practicing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dh%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87%C4%81">dhārana</a> requires introspective focus and practicing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratyahara">pratyahara</a> requires releasing awareness of those external presences (by ‘external presences&rsquo; I&rsquo;m almost certain Patanjali was talking about the other sweaty yoga dudes).</p>

<p>And so once we&rsquo;ve moved our concentration inwards and once we&rsquo;ve learned that the others don&rsquo;t matter. Once we&rsquo;re only concerned about our own bodies and we&rsquo;re building more and more towards the inward concentration, we&rsquo;re told to release competition even within our own selves! And surely the biggest competition we have here is mirrors. How anyone can look inwardly whilst attending a yoga class with a wall of mirrors is beyond me.</p>

<p>But anyway, fuck those other guys. You know the ones, the really strong and bendy ones. Fuck those other guys. I&rsquo;ll out hold them, probably.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from the female perspective, and what competition exists there.</p>
