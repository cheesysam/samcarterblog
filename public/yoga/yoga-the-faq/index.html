<hr/><p>Here are the questions I’ve heard most often when talking to people about starting a yoga practice.
<h3>Do I need to be flexible?</h3>
The physical bit of your yoga class is about working out where your body is today, not where it’s been, and not where it’s going. I often remind my students to have a check in with their body before they start to move, does anything feel different to the last time you were in relaxation? Just a mental scan to see what <em>feels</em> like the present body.</p>

<p>Perhaps the misconception is seated in feeling like one might miss out on some part of the practice if they can’t do it already, but yoga is not something to learn overnight. Touching your toes every day isn’t doing yoga, and doing yoga isn’t touching your toes every day.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> No.
<h3>What do I need to bring with me?</h3>
&ldquo;Clothes you can move about in&rdquo;, is the practical answer I usually give. You don’t need to bring the latest fashionable leggings, thats for certain, although we’re all guilty of getting caught up on that bandwagon.</p>

<p>Sticky yoga mats are a modern invention. Having a surface which will keep hands and feet in place will really build confidence, especially in a pose like Adho Mukha Svanasana. There we’ve got a lot of force going into the mat at the hands, and it’s nice to stick. You can push into the hands and get that wonderful release in the back. But as your practice builds, there’s a good chance you’ll feel a lot less reliance on the mat to keep you in place. The strength of the hip flexors taking the weight back over the heels, the strength in the lower abs sucking everything in to keep the shape of the body tall, and your hands wouldn’t slide away from your feet no matter what the surface is.
Original yoga texts talk of layers of dry grass, banana leaves, and finally an animal skin as a place to practice. Somewhat impractical for the modern class, but the point is it doesn’t really matter*.</p>

<p>What you <em><strong>should</strong></em> bring, is an openness of heart and mind to experience about 90 minutes of movement, breathing, relaxation, and meditation. Yoga, over time, can bring profound changes to the body and mind. When I attended my first class I was expecting to sit on the floor, of course, but having got home and eager to try some of these practices in my own time, it reminded me of a state of mind I’d lost somewhere since childhood, sitting on the floor and being just ‘me’. Over time hopefully your mind too will start to connect back to that feeling of just being you and your body. A you which is a little bit less worried about those niggling anxieties, a little more comfortable in your own skin, and a little bit happier sitting on the floor (or standing on your head, if you’re into that kinda thing).</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Your mind.
<h3>Is it religious?</h3>
Yoga is a religious practice so closely connected to Hinduism that I consider them the same thing. In a Hatha Yoga practice it is common to say “Namaste”, “Om Shanti”, and maybe even some chanting at the end. The words are so subjective to translation from Hindi. OM can mean anything from <em>nature</em>, <em>existence</em>, <em>everything</em>, or just <em>God</em>. The very sound of the word is sometimes interpreted as the sound that is so pure and natural that if you listened carefully enough every single thing in the universe would be making that sound. Whichever you want to take it as, it’s the practice around the word which is the useful bit. If Om to you means the connecting bits between you and your fellow yogi, awesome. If you use it as the seed sound of the universe to focus your meditations on for the rest of your physical existence, awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Only if you want it to be.
<h3>Is yoga good for losing weight?</h3>
Moving around more is going to burn calories. You’ll be doing that at most yoga classes. More importantly what you’ll also be doing is starting to gain a better understanding of your body.</p>

<p>Additionally, with time and practice, there might be a change in your relationship with food. Being mindful about what you eat comes hand in hand with being mindful about how your body moves, what your body needs some days, and what it doesn’t need other days.</p>

<p>Ultimately, any increase in physical movement will aid weight loss. However, attending a class (of anything) once a week, without a change in food habits, is probably not enough to notice any profound weight loss benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. <span style="font-size: small;">(but there are no magic wands :) )</span></p>

<hr />

<p>*Don’t buy those unbelievably cheap generic ‘fitness mat’s, the kind with the inch thick foam which stretches when you put any force into it. You’ll end up throwing it away after a couple of weeks.</p>
