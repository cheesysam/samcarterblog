<hr/><p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about Instagram, and where it fits with my yoga practice. Of course, Instagram certainly isn&rsquo;t a traditional method of yoga practice, but we work with what we&rsquo;ve got. Particularly I&rsquo;d like to talk about whether there are benefits in Instagram, when held agains some of the traditional yoga teachings, in this case Svadhyaya and Santosha.
<h2>Instagram</h2>
I joined Instagram as a direct result of hearing about its vibrant yoga scene. Not long after becoming recognisable as a regular to the yoga class, someone had told me to get involved. The scene is indeed vibrant. It seems almost every other Instagram member is showing off their poses. Stop drop and yoga and all that.
It didn&rsquo;t take long to find some guys doing exactly what it was I wanted to be doing with my asana practice. Finding these role models to aspire to got me working harder and contributing more and more to Instagram. My yoga practice was developing. I can&rsquo;t solely attribute this progress to Instagram, but getting a photo up most days meant I really had to be practicing most days. Every now and then one of the role models I followed intently would throw a comment my way after I shamelessly followed their practice and their style.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a class of Instagram accounts which can only be described as the yoga celebrities. There&rsquo;s no need to name names, no doubt you can list a few without much prompting. But there is a subset of these celebrities who I believe go further, who fit in as more of a role mode. I am all for role models. Throughout life there&rsquo;s never been a time where I haven&rsquo;t been trying to do the same as someone else. For years I&rsquo;ve considered this to be something of a flaw in my own character. Am I really going to be a strong individual, given that never has there been a time when I haven&rsquo;t been admiring someone else and trying to emulate what I see in them? Through some inward looking I&rsquo;ve decided this is only a desire to grow into the individual I hope to be.</p>

<p>The difference I see between celebrities and role models is their intent. A role model might go out of their way to cater to those looking for inspiration. The average celebrity seems to look more inwardly.</p>

<p>Then, how does posting on Instagram and the pursuit of Instagram celebrities as role models fit with the yoga teachings? Two of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyama" target="_blank">niyamas</a> from the eight limbs of yoga, Santosha and Svadhyaya, I believe still have a place alongside the yoga of Instagram.
<h2>Santosha</h2>
Santosha is the yogic practice of self contentment and satisfaction. Through self contentment comes happiness. If we only look at perfection, it&rsquo;s not easy to relinquish making comparisons between others and ourselves. There&rsquo;s powerful emotion in these comparisons, and I doubt the anxiety which accompanies such emotion is alien to anybody.
The yoga celebrities of Instagram should be aware of the status and the accompanying image they project, however it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the detachment from this emotion can only be found within myself. Keeping my practice personal and non-competitive is the answer.
<h2>Svadhyaya</h2>
Svadhyaya is a Sanskrit term in Hinduism which literally means &ldquo;one&rsquo;s own reading&rdquo;. The intent of Svadhyaya is to study the way in which we are developing, to make time to readdress our goals and reassess our path.
Yoga teaches us the value of keeping a sense of presence; but using a record of photographs to observe progress towards a goal I see as a useful tool on the path.</p>

<hr />

<p>At times I&rsquo;ve struggled to do a home practice because of the thought of having to take a picture to put on Instagram. There can be a feeling of pressure to rise to the amazing strength of the people one follows. However, with a little self contentment and a drive to be the best you can be, joining an online community and trying to keep up can be a good step towards happiness.</p>
