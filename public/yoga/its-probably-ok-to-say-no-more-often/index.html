<hr/><p><h3>The Invite.</h3>
Hyper-connected, we receive invitations, sometimes in advance but often ad-hoc. Drinks tonight, dinner tomorrow. Come to that yoga class with me later, and we’ll do ParkRun 9AM tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Isn’t it tiring? Not the events themselves, no*, but the frequency and immediacy of it all. It can be minutes between seeing the event, and being expected to attend.
<h3>Winter.</h3>
<h4>We are just over the peak, and it’s cold.</h4>
Especially during Winter we’re programmed to rest and switch off, even just a little, and go to bed earlier, curl up, and eat more! Out of all the generations of humanity, we are the first one&rsquo;s who are spending artificial day&rsquo;s under artificial lights. Night has arrived outside and we&rsquo;re in the office, working. We get home and the TV is blinding us with cold light late into the evening, our body’s are replying with poor sleep and irritability. Just before bed we stare at our phones and check what&rsquo;s happened that we may have missed out on that evening.</p>

<p>Over the weeks of Christmas just past there were as many reminders, invites, and outings as always. The difference this time was that internal switch, thrown to tell me I didn’t need to say yes to every single gathering. If time for rest is not taken during those weeks, then surely we’ll never find time to rest for the remainder of the year?</p>

<p>And there is a stigma around saying no. After the meal when they say ‘We’re going for drinks next door’, who would make the excuse? ‘Actually, I’m probably going to go home and have a bath instead’. There can be a break in that mindset of everyone doing everything. When the majority live in cities there is no reason we can’t join and leave more freely. Even those on the outskirts are a short car journey away from the action.
<h3>Ahimsa.</h3>
<h4>Non Violence.</h4>
As much as not pursuing fights with others, we’re expected not to pursue fights with ourselves. It’s listening to one’s body and responding with care. Patanjali makes no exception for killing even when it is one’s duty on the battlefield. Patanjali, no doubt, would make no exception for telling ourselves that we must drag our body through another round at the bar when we’re being told by ourselves that it’s quite enough.</p>

<p>I see room for change in the expectations of society, that we can look after ourselves again, and not miss out on this gentle slow-down over the Winter.
<h3>Missing Out.</h3>
<h4>Yoga.</h4>
There <em>is</em> more to it, of course there is. Sometimes the anxiety of missing out on something can tear through the mind before we’ve had a chance to ask, ‘Am I thinking, with reason?’. That&rsquo;s where yoga comes in, switching to our thoughts. The mind needs to practice this to become strong, no differently from practicing the muscles of the body to become stronger.</p>
