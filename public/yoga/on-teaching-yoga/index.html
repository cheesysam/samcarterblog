<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">On Teaching Yoga</div><div class="section" id="content">Fri Feb 17, 2017 &#183; 412 words

<hr/><p>Feelings on being a yoga teacher. A little more personal. A constantly changing topic, and a list which is constantly being added to. This is the first in a series of &ldquo;diary&rdquo; like posts on the subject. I&rsquo;ll try to keep some themes/stats running as a constant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Diary,
Classes taught since I&rsquo;ve qualified: 63</p>

<p>Individuals taught: No idea really, probably a couple of hundred at least</p>

<p>Most difficult thing since starting teaching: Teaching yoga is definitely not without it&rsquo;s challenges. The business side of things is a big learning point for me. It&rsquo;s not something covered in teacher training! Every aspect of running a business is new so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to develop at the moment. Money and tax, creating a consistent image, networking and building relations with other individuals and businesses!</p>

<p>Most enjoyable thing since starting teaching: Meeting the most wonderful people! I never know who&rsquo;s going to walk through the door. Historically I&rsquo;ve struggled with chatting to random strangers (especially groups!), so this was a serious jump into the deep end, I&rsquo;m grateful for the people who told me I could do it, I&rsquo;ll never forget the support.</p>

<hr />

<p>With any endeavour there is a rapid growth period at the start and then it tends to start becoming a bit more of a refining process. This goes for yoga practice, yoga teaching, and just about any skill I&rsquo;ve ever learned. Getting to a point where I could competently teach a yoga class took years of developing my own practice and then years of deepening that knowledge until I was capable of presenting what I knew to others. Now that I have that basic level it&rsquo;s becoming more about the subtleties. For example, how do I make a newcomer feel welcome in a group of people who <i>seem</i>Â much more experienced? It&rsquo;s different depending on any individual, but if you ever find yourself in this situation as a newcomer then take it from me that everyone else in the class is probably making it up as they go along, doing their best to come across as knowing what they&rsquo;re doing! (The teacher certainly will be). Anyway, that&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m learning.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s was a lightning fast two years of yoga teacher training. I&rsquo;m sure over the two years I ended with more questions than answers, but it&rsquo;s that constant curiosity which keeps us alive and growing. Theres always more to learn, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve finished. You don&rsquo;t finish yoga.</p>
