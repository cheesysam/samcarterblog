<hr/><p><h3>Southsea Fitness Festival</h3>
Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be taking the stage at one of the Summer&rsquo;s regular events here in Portsmouth. This will be the third year running that the Southsea Fitness Festival has set up on Castle Field. It is a collection of all the local gyms, sports centres, and independent sport classes, promoting their services. With Portsmouth Yoga I head there each year to help out talking to people about yoga and getting involved with whatever activities are going on.</p>

<p>When I was looking down the list of other hosts, there was a mixture of the more common sports such as running, tennis, and swimming, alongside some of the more of the more alternative sports such as archery and dance. What these have in common is they are very firmly &lsquo;sports&rsquo;, compared to yoga which I&rsquo;ve never seen as sport. However yoga is always involved in events such as this, but should it be?</p>

<hr />

<p><h3>Just Physical Fitness?</h3>
Whilst it&rsquo;s true that yoga is going to get you fit if you do enough of it, you could say the same of any physical activity. Vacuuming the house is recognised as having positive health benefits, requiring a surprisingly high amount of energy for something usually done begrudgingly but also done often. But I wouldn&rsquo;t put vacuuming on the bill at a fitness festival.</p>

<p>If you were to go to your average high street chain of budget gym, they might have an offering of a 45 minute yoga class. Whilst this is going through what would be familiar poses it&rsquo;s a struggle to call it yoga as it would miss so much of the spiritual background and mental health benefit that a dedicated yoga studio would offer.</p>

<p>A lot of yogi&rsquo;s would argue that the only purpose of strengthening the body through the asanas is to enable staying in a meditation for longer and longer periods of time without the need to move or slouch. Letting the body get out of the way of the mind doing it&rsquo;s work. Not something I disagree with, but asana in itself is good fun, and not something I&rsquo;d like to think of as just a tool for something else.</p>

<p>In my experience the benefits yoga gives to mental health is the foundation. Once that foundation has been made then the mind makes way for everything else. Time seems to go more steadily when the mind is at it&rsquo;s strongest and the troubles of fitness, eating well, good use of one&rsquo;s time, all these things work themselves out.</p>

<p>So to put an end to this ramble. Yoga gives that strength of mind, enough to start getting ready for anything else life is going to throw at you. Whether it&rsquo;s developing that strength for further meditation, letting your mind have a proper rest each day, or just managing the anxiety of getting on stage to teach yoga to a mass of skeptical fitness fanatics.</p>

<p>Om Shanti</p>
