      <description>There was no tragedy in Granddad&amp;rsquo;s death. No shock in it&amp;rsquo;s happening, not was anybody anything but impressed by his ability to live in his own home until such an old age. It happened over the course of about 6 weeks. The lung cancer diagnosis, followed by infection. For a period of time it was considered he would have radiotherapy, but that decision was reversed when quickly became worse. I saw him twice during that time.</description>

      <description>To open the 2018 World Cup, Russia hired Robbie Williams to perform at the ceremony. During the broadcast he gave the camera a cheeky middle finger. In the USA Fox News had to apologise to it&amp;rsquo;s viewers for streaming this atrocity live. In the UK we published the picture on the front page of our newspapers.</description>
