<div><span id="tag"><a href="http://d27j66pmjudaqa.cloudfront.net/tags/blog">blog</a></span></div><hr/><p>There was no tragedy in Granddad&rsquo;s death. No shock in it&rsquo;s happening, not was anybody anything but impressed by his ability to live in his own home until such an old age. It happened over the course of about 6 weeks. The lung cancer diagnosis, followed by infection. For a period of time it was considered he would have radiotherapy, but that decision was reversed when quickly became worse.</p>

<p>I saw him twice during that time. Once with just Dad and Wendy, and once with the much wider family. We visited him at his home in Evesham. The most apparent thing in the house was how decayed everything had become. Thread bare cushions, the bathroom was untidy which matched most of the rest of the house. The garden however was fantastically well kept. Jenny wasn&rsquo;t sure whether to visit or not before the event because nobody knew enough to tell her whether it would be worth it.</p>

<p>There is so much uncertainty around death. What to say, how to deal with the others who are involved. But internally as well, uncertainty in how this should affect me, how it might affect me later. What might I need to do now to be strong about it later. Mourning and bereavement as processes are ill defined, in the same manner that all these things are. There&rsquo;s no point at which I was overcome with emotion or felt the need to be upset. The loss was expected, and perhaps internally prepared for.
To my Granddad, who was a parent to me, and a badass at living.</p>
