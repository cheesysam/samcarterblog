      <description>The view of India I am familiar with is the one portrayed by the commercial yoga industry. Overlooking the poverty, the violent past, and the &amp;lsquo;unwestern&amp;rsquo; tenets of Hinduism leaves India painted in a positive light. Beneficial when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to sell an ideology to someone.
Newby doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same goal as a modern yoga teacher. In Slowly Down the Ganges, Newby doesn&amp;rsquo;t shy away from pointing out the other side of Hinduism and wider Indian culture.</description>

      <description>We ate outside, discussing species of tree. The helicopter ones, and the ones they have in Japan. We prolonged it somewhat, on account of the heat. The afternoon went quickly, we chatted a lot more than we usually get away with.
At home I played catch with one of the three boys. He’s got a good throw. I had to change clothes before and after due to the heat.
Later on, our landlords had guests visiting, a mother and daughter.</description>

      <description>It’s disappointing how dictated it is that one will end up like their parents. I struggle to accept that all traits persist. I hope the really irritating things disappear altogether. I really hope they don’t skip a generation.</description>

      <description>There was no tragedy in Granddad&amp;rsquo;s death. No shock in it&amp;rsquo;s happening, not was anybody anything but impressed by his ability to live in his own home until such an old age. It happened over the course of about 6 weeks. The lung cancer diagnosis, followed by infection. For a period of time it was considered he would have radiotherapy, but that decision was reversed when quickly became worse.
I saw him twice during that time.</description>

      <description>To open the 2018 World Cup, Russia hired Robbie Williams to perform at the ceremony. During the broadcast he gave the camera a cheeky middle finger. In the USA Fox News had to apologise to it&amp;rsquo;s viewers for streaming this atrocity live. In the UK we published the picture on the front page of our newspapers.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a proper philosophy. Not one of my own. I&amp;rsquo;ve had fleeting infatuations with the philosophy of others, but never more than that. And a philosophy which can be consumed emphatically is quickly found by someone who is looking.</description>
